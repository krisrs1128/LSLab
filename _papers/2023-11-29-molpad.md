abstract: 
The R-Shiny package MolPad provides an interactive dashboard for understanding the dynamics of longitudinal molecular co-expression in microbiomics. The main idea for addressing the issue is first to use a network to overview major patterns among their predictive relationships and then zoom into specific clusters of interest. It is designed with a focus-plus-context analysis strategy and automatically generates links to online curated annotations. The dashboard consists of a cluster-level network, a bar plot of taxonomic composition, a line plot of data modalities, and a table for each pathway. Further, the package includes functions that handle the data processing for creating the dashboard. This makes it beginner-friendly for users with less R programming experience. We illustrate these methods with a case study on a longitudinal metagenomics analysis of the cheese microbiome. [Demo](https://connect.doit.wisc.edu/molpad-demo/).
