abstract: Society's capacity for algorithmic problem-solving has never been greater.  Artificial Intelligence is now applied across more domains than ever, a consequence of powerful abstractions, abundant data, and accessible software. As capabilities have expanded, so have risks, with models often deployed without fully understanding their potential impacts. Interpretable and interactive machine learning aims to make complex models more transparent and controllable, enhancing user agency. This review synthesizes key principles from the growing literature in this field.  We first introduce precise vocabulary for discussing interpretability, like the distinction between glass box and explainable algorithms. We then explore connections to classical statistical and design principles, like parsimony and the gulfs of interaction. Basic explainability techniques -- including learned embeddings, integrated gradients, and concept bottlenecks -- are illustrated with a simple case study. We also review criteria for objectively evaluating interpretability approaches. Throughout, we underscore the importance of considering audience goals when designing interactive algorithmic systems.  Finally, we outline open challenges and discuss the potential role of data science in addressing them.
