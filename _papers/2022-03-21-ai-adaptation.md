abstract: Although artificial intelligence (AI; inclusive of machine learning) is gaining
traction supporting climate change projections and impacts, limited work
has used AI to address climate change adaptation. We identify this gap and
highlight the value of AI especially in supporting complex adaptation
choices and implementation. We illustrate how AI can effectively leverage
precise, real-time information in data-scarce settings. We focus on supervised
learning, transfer learning, reinforcement learning, and multimodal
learning to illustrate how innovative AI methods can enable better-informed
choices, tailor adaptation measures to heterogenous groups and generate
effective synergies and trade-offs.
