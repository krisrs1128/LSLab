    Modern sequencing, imaging, and spectroscopy technologies give a window into
    complex biological environments. However, exploring these data without
    getting lost remains a challenge — statistical methods can help chart out
    the territory. We are interested in building models and interfaces that help
    researchers summarize general patterns, spot interesting relationships, and
    articulate uncertainty. We have worked with probabilistic and latent
    variable models to better incorporate contextual knowledge and integrate
    complementary data sources. We implement software packages that translate
    statistical and visualization theory into flexible and accessible tools for
    the research community.

  <h2>Interactivity and visualization in earth system monitoring</h2>

      Climate change has affected many earth systems, and data about these
      changes can guide societal adaptation. Remote sensing instruments can
      provide detailed views of ecosystems at a global scale, but manual
      annotation and summarization is an overwhelming task. Features of interest
      can be few and far between, and designing models that work well across
      different environments remains a challenge. We adapt ideas from machine
      learning and data visualization to make remote sensing data useful for
      practical downstream tasks.
